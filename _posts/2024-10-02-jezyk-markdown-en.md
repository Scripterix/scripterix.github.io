## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that lets you format text with plain characters. Instead of clicking toolbar buttons, you add asterisks, hashes, and backticks so the source stays readable in any `.md` file.

## Where Markdown shines

- Technical docs and README files on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket
- Second-brain apps for notes like Obsidian, Notion, or Joplin
- Static-site blogs built with Jekyll, Hugo, and similar generators
- Team chat tools, including Slack and Discord

## Key benefits

- **Simple syntax** — easy to remember and quick to type
- **Lightweight** — plain-text files that open anywhere
- **Portable** — convert to HTML, PDF, slides, or blog posts without friction
- **Tooling support** — embraced by IDEs, CMSs, and developer platforms

## Core syntax

### Headings

- `#` – Heading 1 (primary page title)
- `##` – Heading 2
- `###` – Heading 3 and deeper levels

### Emphasis

- `*Italic text*`
- `**Bold text**`
- `~~Strikethrough~~`

Rendered form: *italic*, **bold**, ~~strikethrough~~.

### Lists

```markdown
- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Nested item 2a
  - Nested item 2b
```

### Links

```markdown
[Visit the site](https://www.example.com)
[Link with title](https://www.example.com "Link title")
```

### Quotes and code

> This is a blockquote styled note.

`command --help`

```markdown
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

## What next?

Markdown is a quick win for blogs, notes, and documentation. Pick your favorite editor, start with headings and lists, then layer in links, images, and code blocks. Consistent practice will make the syntax second nature.
