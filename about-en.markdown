## Journey into web development

My internet adventure started in 2008 when I needed to launch an online store and could not find a developer I fully trusted. I decided to learn the craft myself, and that choice sparked a long-term fascination with programming.

After six weeks of research, buying hosting, and registering a domain, I launched **Sweetshop.pl** on the Zend Commerce platform. The store specialised in decoupage supplies and funded each new iteration from revenue.

### Magento era

When Magento arrived in 2008, I migrated the store to **Magento 1.0.9**. It delivered better performance, richer features, and precise SEO controls. To keep improving the build I mastered HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, PHP, the Zend Framework, and designed the visuals in Photoshop.

### Early client work

Friends soon asked for help. I built and maintained the Café Philosophique community site for philosophy meetups, then partnered with ACS on **x4y.pl**, a Magento-powered store for printing supplies. Within months it attracted over 1,500 daily users and generated valuable B2B leads thanks to a custom configurator and solid SEO.

In 2010 I launched **Subcomm.pl**, a winch and accessories shop, followed by **MiauHau.com**, a 4,000-product pet store developed with a three-person team. We combined SEO, word-of-mouth tactics, and social media to grow the brand.

### Expanding the stack

I delivered the responsive **Jakoscelevator.pl** website, translating content from English into Polish, and later created **Job-Visa.pl** on WordPress with a responsive template and original English copy.

### Today

I now focus on Scripterix initiatives and long-term collaborations with clients, including projects for Seven.auto.pl and Bramy-Józefów.com. I'm open to B2B contracts, clearly scoped engagements, and paid internships with agencies or software houses.
