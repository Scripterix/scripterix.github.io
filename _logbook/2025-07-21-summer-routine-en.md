I keep a rhythm of two publications per week. Today's two hours were used for:

1. Updating the content spreadsheet — added a series about automated testing.
2. Preparing scripts for short videos (YouTube Shorts / IG Reels).
3. Reviewing the GitHub Actions pipeline for automatic post thumbnail generation.

To do next: experiment with generating prompts for SORA and create an FAQ section for the 10k site.
