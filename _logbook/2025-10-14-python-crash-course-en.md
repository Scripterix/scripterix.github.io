summary: "3 hours configuring the environment and first steps with Python: variables, data types, operators, basic syntax."

An extra language — why not. Python is useful for AI and has many interesting applications. Therefore I start a basic course: what, where, how. Given the popularity of this language and its broad use in Machine Learning, I decided to learn it.

## Python - Crash Course Logbook Entry

During the 3-hour session I set up the Python development environment on my machine, installing Python 3.11. I then went through the language basics including variables, data types (int, float, str, bool), arithmetic and logical operators, and basic syntax (if, loops).

## I'm curious about Python and its automation capabilities

Many tasks and integrations with AI tools are essential. I plan to continue learning and explore libraries such as NumPy, Pandas and machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.

## Schedule (3h) and environment setup

- Downloaded and installed Python 3.11 from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Installed Visual Studio Code and the Python extension.
- Installed basic packages (pip). It turned out there is not always straightforward pip support on Windows Home.
- Tested the installation by running a simple "Hello, World!" script.
- Documented the configuration steps in notes.
- Reviewed available resources and online tutorials.
- Read through Python documentation.
- Created a GitHub repository to store code.
