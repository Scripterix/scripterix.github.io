Focused on the basics of components and modules in Angular. I also created a 30-day checklist to keep a two-hour daily rhythm. Key steps:

- Installed tools (`nvm`, `npm`, `angular-cli`).
- Configured the repository for the "Challenge10k" series.
- Reviewed earlier 2024 notes to maintain continuity.

Ending the session feeling the plan is realistic. Next sessions will focus on routing and initial services.
