## Project start

The goal was clear: launch a complete Magento 1 store and make it a practical sales channel, not just an online brochure.

## Team delivery scope

### Technical foundation

- Magento 1 installation and configuration.
- Store theme setup and category structure.
- Checkout flow preparation and transactional page setup.

### Product catalog and pricing

- Another team member prepared the product list based on product codes and an XLS pricing table.
- Prices were calculated from EUR using an agreed conversion factor.
- This kept online pricing aligned with actual commercial terms.

### Shipping and payment integrations

- Integration of required shipping modules.
- Integration of required payment modules.
- End-to-end order flow from product selection to checkout completion.

## My contribution: SEO and Google Ads

- I handled the main SEO work to improve rankings for sales-intent queries.
- I planned and optimized Google Ads campaigns.
- The goal was to deliver qualified traffic into a fully working ecommerce funnel.

## Time and operating model

- Around 160 hours total team effort.
- Delivery timeline: approximately 3 months.
- Work rhythm: a few hours daily between ongoing commercial operations.

## Outcome

The project delivered a working 24/7 online sales channel with catalog consistency, functioning checkout integrations, and stable acquisition support from SEO and Google Ads.
