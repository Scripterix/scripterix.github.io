A retrospective case study of the 2018 Laravel-based relaunch for OpenGateWeb.

This fake portfolio entry captures the structure of the real engagements from that period: multi-language routing, SSR templates, and a modular component library compiled with Laravel Mix. It also references the automation checklists and style guide maintained in parallel Google Sheets.
