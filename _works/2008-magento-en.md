Case study project x4y.pl (printers and supplies): This project delivered a full Magento 1 ecommerce store in 2008 conditions: technical setup, product catalog operations, checkout integrations, and performance marketing support.

## Project context

At that time, sales were heavily dependent on traditional field workflows. The objective was to launch an online channel that could structure products, keep prices up to date, and generate qualified leads for the sales team.

## Scope and team responsibilities

### 1. Magento setup and theme

- Magento 1 installation and base configuration.
- Theme implementation and storefront structure.
- Checkout flow setup.

### 2. Product catalog and XLS price table

- Another team member prepared the product list based on product codes and an XLS pricing table.
- Product pricing followed an EUR conversion factor defined for the business.
- This kept online pricing aligned with real commercial terms.

### 3. Sales-critical integrations

- Integration of required shipping modules.
- Integration of payment modules.
- End-to-end checkout flow from product selection to order confirmation.

### 4. SEO and Google Ads (my responsibility)

- Strong SEO work for high-intent product queries.
- Google Ads campaign setup and optimization.
- Continuous support of lead generation for the sales process.

## Delivery model and effort

- Team-based delivery over roughly 3 months.
- Around 160 hours total (team estimate).
- Work was done in daily blocks, between ongoing commercial operations.

## Outcome

The store became a working sales channel, not just an online catalog. The technical Magento foundation, catalog discipline, and acquisition work (SEO + Google Ads) enabled measurable online demand generation.
